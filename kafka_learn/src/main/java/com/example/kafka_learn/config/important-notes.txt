The logs you provided are related to a Kafka producer and indicate that the producer has been instantiated and is ready to send messages to the Kafka cluster. However, you mentioned that your consumer is not able to consume messages. Let's walk through some troubleshooting steps to identify the issue:

### 1. **Check if Messages are Being Produced:**
   - Ensure that the producer is actually sending messages to the `string-topic`. You can check this by either using Kafka's command-line tools (`kafka-console-consumer.sh`) to consume messages from the topic or by monitoring the topic using a tool like `Kafka Manager` or `Confluent Control Center`.

### 2. **Consumer Configuration:**
   - **Group ID Consistency:** Ensure that the group ID used in the consumer configuration is consistent with the one used in the `@KafkaListener` annotation.
   - **Topic Subscription:** Verify that the topic name (`string-topic`) is correctly specified in both the producer and consumer configurations.

### 3. **Kafka Broker Connection:**
   - Ensure that the consumer is correctly connecting to the Kafka broker. Double-check the `bootstrap.servers` configuration in your consumer properties.

### 4. **Consumer Logs:**
   - Check the logs for the consumer side. Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate a connection issue, deserialization problem, or offset issue.

### 5. **Check Consumer Offsets:**
   - If the consumer group has already consumed messages, it may not receive new messages unless the producer sends new ones. To reset the consumer group offset, you can set the `auto.offset.reset` to `earliest` in the consumer configuration, ensuring it reads from the beginning of the topic.

### 6. **Enable Debug Logging:**
   - Enable debug logging for Kafka consumers to get more detailed information about whatâ€™s happening:
   ```properties
   logging.level.org.apache.kafka=DEBUG
   logging.level.org.springframework.kafka=DEBUG
   ```

### 7. **Producer Acknowledgements:**
   - Ensure that the producer is configured to wait for acknowledgments (`acks=all`) to guarantee that messages are properly sent to Kafka before the producer proceeds.

### 8. **Zookeeper and Broker Health:**
   - Ensure that Zookeeper and all Kafka brokers are running and healthy. Sometimes issues in the cluster can prevent messages from being consumed correctly.

### 9. **Firewall and Network Issues:**
   - Check if there are any network or firewall issues that might be preventing the consumer from connecting to the broker.

### 10. **Check for Partition Assignment:**
   - Ensure that the consumer is assigned to the correct partitions of the topic. If you have multiple consumers in the same group, make sure they are not all being assigned to the same partition or that the partitions are evenly distributed.

### Example Commands for Manual Checking:
- **Consume Messages Using Console:**
  ```sh
  kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic string-topic --from-beginning
  ```
- **Describe Topic to Check Partitions:**
  ```sh
  kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic string-topic
  ```

### Summary

- Ensure that your consumer is correctly configured to connect to the Kafka broker and that it is subscribing to the correct topic.
- Check that messages are actually being produced to the topic.
- Investigate the consumer logs for any clues as to why it's not consuming messages.
- Use Kafka tools to manually verify the presence of messages in the topic and ensure the consumer is correctly assigned to the partitions.

If you follow these steps and check each component, you should be able to identify why the consumer isn't receiving messages.

On Windows, you can use the `kafka-console-consumer.bat` script to consume messages from a Kafka topic. Here's how you can do it:

### Steps to Run `kafka-console-consumer` on Windows:

1. **Navigate to Kafka's `bin` Directory:**
   Open a command prompt and navigate to the `bin\windows` directory of your Kafka installation. For example:
   ```sh
   cd C:\kafka\bin\windows
   ```

2. **Run the Console Consumer:**
   Use the following command to start consuming messages from the `string-topic` topic from the beginning:
   ```sh
   kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic string-topic --from-beginning
   ```

   - `--bootstrap-server localhost:9092`: Specifies the address of your Kafka broker.
   - `--topic string-topic`: Specifies the topic name you want to consume messages from.
   - `--from-beginning`: Consumes messages from the beginning of the topic.

### Example:
```sh
C:\kafka\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic string-topic --from-beginning
```

### Additional Notes:
- Ensure that your Kafka broker is running and accessible at `localhost:9092`.
- If you're using a different host or port for your Kafka broker, replace `localhost:9092` with the correct address.
- If you haven't added the Kafka `bin\windows` directory to your system's PATH environment variable, you need to navigate to that directory each time to run the Kafka tools.

This command will display the messages in the `string-topic` topic directly in your command prompt window.

# consumers versus topic relationship
# same group-id , same topic , one or more different consumer [having more consumer in a consumer group]
#######

Yes, two or more consumers can have the same `group.id` in Apache Kafka, and this is actually a common pattern. Here's how it works:

### How Consumers with the Same Group ID Work

1. **Consumer Group:**
   - A **consumer group** is a set of consumers that share the same `group.id`. Kafka ensures that each partition of a topic is consumed by exactly one consumer within a group.

2. **Partition Assignment:**
   - When multiple consumers in the same group subscribe to a topic, Kafka will assign partitions to each consumer. If a topic has multiple partitions, Kafka will distribute these partitions among the consumers.
   - If there are more consumers than partitions, some consumers may be idle because Kafka will assign only one consumer per partition within a group.

3. **Load Balancing:**
   - Kafka automatically handles the assignment and reassignment of partitions to consumers in a group. If a consumer fails or leaves the group, the partitions assigned to it are reassigned to the remaining consumers.

4. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - If a consumer in the group fails, another consumer will take over the partitions it was responsible for, ensuring that message consumption continues without interruption.

### Example Scenario

- **Scenario 1:** Topic `example-topic` has 4 partitions, and you have 2 consumers with the same `group.id`:
  - Kafka will assign 2 partitions to each consumer.

- **Scenario 2:** If you have 4 consumers with the same `group.id`:
  - Each consumer will be assigned 1 partition.

- **Scenario 3:** If you have 5 consumers with the same `group.id`:
  - 4 consumers will be assigned 1 partition each, and 1 consumer will be idle, as there are only 4 partitions.

### Use Cases

- **Parallel Processing:** Having multiple consumers with the same `group.id` allows for parallel processing of messages across different partitions of a topic.
- **Scalability:** You can add more consumers to the group to scale the consumption capacity as needed.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If a consumer in the group fails, the remaining consumers can take over its work, ensuring high availability.

### Important Points to Remember

- **Message Ordering:** Within a partition, message order is maintained. However, across different partitions, order is not guaranteed. If multiple consumers process messages, they may not process them in the exact order they were produced.
- **At-Least-Once Delivery:** Consumers in a group commit their offsets, and Kafka guarantees at-least-once delivery semantics. If a consumer fails before committing an offset, the messages might be reprocessed by another consumer.

### Conclusion

Using the same `group.id` for multiple consumers is a powerful feature in Kafka that allows for scalable, parallel processing and ensures fault tolerance. It's an essential concept for building robust and distributed data processing applications.

# consumers versus topic relationship
# same group-id , different topic , one or more different consumer [having more consumer in a consumer group]
#######

When you have multiple consumers with the same `group.id` but they are subscribed to different topics, they function independently from each other. Here's how it works:

### Different Topics with the Same `group.id`

1. **Independent Consumption:**
   - Each consumer will consume messages from its assigned topic(s) independently of the other consumers, even though they share the same `group.id`.
   - The consumers will not interfere with each other because Kafka's consumer group management is partitioned by both `group.id` and topic.

2. **No Partition Assignment Sharing:**
   - Since the consumers are subscribed to different topics, there is no partition sharing or balancing between them. Each consumer will be responsible only for the partitions of the topic it is subscribed to.

3. **Offsets and Consumer Groups:**
   - Kafka maintains offsets on a per-group and per-topic basis. This means the offset management for each topic is separate, even if the consumers share the same `group.id`.
   - The consumers' progress (i.e., the offsets) on each topic will be tracked separately in Kafka.

### Example Scenario

- **Consumer A:**
  - `group.id = "my-group"`
  - Subscribed to `topic1`

- **Consumer B:**
  - `group.id = "my-group"`
  - Subscribed to `topic2`

In this scenario:
- Consumer A will consume messages from `topic1`.
- Consumer B will consume messages from `topic2`.
- Even though both consumers have the same `group.id`, they are working on different topics, so they will not interact or share partitions with each other.

### Use Cases

- **Isolated Workflows:** You might have different consumers doing different types of processing or handling different data streams, but you want to manage them under the same consumer group for organizational or monitoring reasons.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Having a consistent `group.id` across different applications or microservices, even if they handle different topics, can simplify configuration management.

### Important Considerations

- **No Cross-Topic Coordination:** The same `group.id` does not imply any coordination between consumers on different topics. They will not share partitions or coordinate in any way.
- **Consumer Group Offsets:** Offsets for each topic are managed independently, so resetting offsets on one topic will not affect the other.

### Conclusion

Consumers with the same `group.id` but different topic subscriptions operate independently. They do not share partition assignments, and their offsets are managed separately by Kafka. This setup allows you to manage different consumers under a common group identifier without coupling their operations.

# consumers versus topic relationship
# different group-id each having  one or more different consumer [having more consumer in a consumer group], same topic ,
#######

When you have multiple consumers subscribed to the same topic but each with a different `group.id`, they operate independently, each receiving a full copy of the messages from the topic. Here's how it works:

### Same Topic with Different `group.id`

1. **Independent Consumption:**
   - Each consumer group processes the messages from the topic independently of the other groups.
   - Since each consumer group is treated separately, each group will get its own copy of every message in the topic.

2. **Partition Assignment:**
   - Within each consumer group, the partitions of the topic are divided among the consumers in that group. If a consumer group has multiple consumers, Kafka will distribute the topic's partitions among those consumers.
   - Different consumer groups do not share partitions or coordinate with each other.

3. **Offsets and Consumer Groups:**
   - Kafka tracks the offsets independently for each consumer group. This means that each group will have its own progress in reading the topic.
   - If one group has processed a message and committed its offset, other groups may still process the same message independently.

### Example Scenario

- **Consumer Group A (group.id = "groupA"):**
  - Subscribed to `topic1`
  - Contains Consumer A1 and Consumer A2
  - Kafka will divide the partitions of `topic1` among Consumer A1 and Consumer A2.

- **Consumer Group B (group.id = "groupB"):**
  - Subscribed to `topic1`
  - Contains Consumer B1 and Consumer B2
  - Kafka will divide the partitions of `topic1` among Consumer B1 and Consumer B2.

In this scenario:
- Both Group A and Group B will each receive all the messages in `topic1`.
- Each group processes the messages independently, so the progress of one group does not affect the other.
- Within each group, the consumers will share the work by dividing the partitions among themselves.

### Use Cases

- **Different Processing Logic:** You might have different consumer groups for different purposes. For example, one group might process the data for real-time analytics, while another group stores the data for batch processing.
- **Multiple Applications:** Different applications or microservices might need to consume the same data stream but process it in different ways. By using different `group.id`s, each application can independently consume the data.
- **Retry Mechanisms:** You can have a separate consumer group to reprocess messages that failed in the original group.

### Important Considerations

- **Message Duplication Across Groups:** Since each group receives its own copy of the messages, if you have many consumer groups reading the same topic, this can lead to duplicated processing.
- **Resource Utilization:** More consumer groups mean more resources being used, as each group consumes and processes the entire topic.

### Conclusion

When consumers use different `group.id`s but subscribe to the same topic, they act as independent consumers, each processing the full set of messages from the topic. This allows different consumer groups to process the same data stream in parallel but independently of one another.
